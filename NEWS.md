Notable changes since last release ([v1.13.3643](https://github.com/rotators/Fo1in2/releases/tag/v1.13.3643))

- **Fixed**: The Special Encounters mechanic has been moved into script and is now selecting maps with the same chances as in original Fo1.
- **Tweaked**: Cavern / Mine encounter spawn chance increases slightly if the player has the Explorer perk.
