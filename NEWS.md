Notable changes since last release ([v1.13.3643](https://github.com/rotators/Fo1in2/releases/tag/v1.13.3643))

- **Added**: Auto-push feature for party members.
- **Fixed**: "Kill Killian"-quest marker wouldn't show up.
- **Fixed**: Garret's fridge would still not close correctly.
- **Fixed**: Invisible Vasquez would occasionally open doors.
- **Fixed**: Players with INT < 4 wouldn't get moved to the V13 library after returning the water chip.
- **Fixed**: Removed Cat's Paw magazine from Shady Sands map (was added by Fixt for some reason).
- **Fixed**: The Special Encounters mechanic has been moved into script and is now selecting maps with the same chances as in original Fo1.
- **Fixed**: The position of the roaming deathclaws in the Boneyard will reset after some time has passed to prevent rare out-of-bounds issue.
- **Fixed**: Using the stealing skill on the disabled Mr Handy in Mariposa would print an error-message.
- **Fixed**: Vault 13 Town/World interface entry points would disable already after just destroying either the Cathedral or Mariposa.
- **Tweaked**: "Glow" and "Vats" mountain encounter table chances are reduced (this was a Fixt addition). If the roll fails, the original "Vault" table is used instead.
- **Tweaked**: Cavern / Mine encounter spawn chance increases slightly if the player has the Explorer perk.
- **Tweaked**: Improved the eyeboat companion script and dialog a little bit for clarity. It can also be repaired with tools now.
- **Tweaked**: Meat Jerky item is a "drug" now and can be used in the same way as iguana-on-a-stick.
- **Tweaked**: Super mutant patrols in the mountains around Mariposa will be smaller now (was a Fixt addition, tweaked for better vanilla compatibility).
- **Tweaked**: When getting kicked out by Hightower in the Hub, the whole party will be moved out of the house now, not just the player.
