Notable changes since last release ([v1.13.3643](https://github.com/rotators/Fo1in2/releases/tag/v1.13.3643))

- **Fixed**: "Kill Killian"-quest marker wouldn't show up.
- **Fixed**: Garret's fridge would still not close correctly.
- **Fixed**: Removed Cat's Paw magazine from Shady Sands map (was added by Fixt for some reason).
- **Fixed**: The Special Encounters mechanic has been moved into script and is now selecting maps with the same chances as in original Fo1.
- **Tweaked**: "Glow" and "Vats" mountain encounter table chances are reduced (this was a Fixt addition). If the roll fails, the original "Vault" table is used instead.
- **Tweaked**: Cavern / Mine encounter spawn chance increases slightly if the player has the Explorer perk.
- **Tweaked**: Meat Jerky item is a "drug" now and can be used in the same way as iguana-on-a-stick.
