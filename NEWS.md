Notable changes since last release ([v1.12.3613](https://github.com/rotators/Fo1in2/releases/tag/v1.12.3613))

- **Fixed**: Corrected item flags for all armors.
- **Fixed**: Corrected the armor stats (DT/DR) of Leather Jacket and Hardened Power Armor.
- **Fixed**: EMP DR in base protos of Ian, Tycho, and Katja. They would lose all EMP DR if they were unarmored before leveling up.
- **Fixed**: EXP for freeing Tandi would show even if the values was reduced down to 0 due to killing all the Khan raiders.
- **Fixed**: Removed built-in armor for Vasquez (he doesn't have armor in his slot).
- **Tweaked**: Pulse Rifle can randomly spawn in special cavern encounter loot boxes (extremely rare)
- **Tweaked**: Pulse Rifle will now need 2 ammo to fire
- **Tweaked**: When cheating the Regulators Holodisk into players inventory and using, the quest with Jon Zimmerman can be progressed now, without having to talk to Razor first. It's a fail-safe and has no other effects on regular gameplay.
