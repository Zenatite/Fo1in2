/*

   Mariposa - Nightkin Sergeant, cut content

   NOTE:
      Nightkin sargeant in the Vats control room? Would make sense, since the technicians (CHOCTECH) would
      originally react differently to the player if that team has been taken out.
      The total team count was 4, as defined in MBENT for some reason (never used there either).
